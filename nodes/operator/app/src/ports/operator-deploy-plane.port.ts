/**
 * Module: `@ports/operator-deploy-plane`
 * Purpose: Operator-local deploy control plane for candidate flight dispatch.
 * Scope: Interface only. Keeps hosted deploy operations out of shared AI-tool capabilities.
 * Invariants:
 *   - OPERATOR_OWNS_DEPLOY: deploy mutations target the operator parent repo/workflows.
 *   - NODE_REF_ARTIFACT_GATE: node-ref flight dispatch requires a resolvable source artifact.
 *   - ONE_PROMOTION_PRIMITIVE: every promotion rung (candidate-a, preview, production)
 *     dispatches `promote-and-deploy.yml` directly via the operator App — no rung routes
 *     through a code-branch PR. Preview is SOURCE-ADDRESSED by the node image sha
 *     (`node_source_sha` input, like candidate-flight): the workflow resolves the image from
 *     the input and records the pin on `deploy/preview`, writing ZERO commits to `main`
 *     (task.5022; the App's main-write privilege is reserved for governance/code merges).
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/node-ci-cd-contract.md, src/app/api/v1/vcs/flight/route.ts
 * @public
