# Multi-Repo Sync Contract

## Context

Cogni's deployment artifacts span three git repos today:

- `Cogni-DAO/cogni` — the **operator control-plane hub**. Holds `nodes/operator/`, submodule pins for hosted node repos, any remaining legacy in-tree node directories while they are being migrated, plus the canonical `scripts/ci/`, `infra/k8s/base/`, `.github/workflows/`, `infra/compose/`, `infra/catalog/`.
- `Cogni-DAO/node-template` — the **canonical node-at-root template**. Public source for named node forks. The hub may pin it as a submodule/deployment row, but does not mirror its source under `nodes/node-template/**`.
- `Cogni-DAO/cogni-poly` — a **per-node fork artifact**. Polymarket-specific node that historically branched off node-template; continues to land operator-scope CI/infra fixes that the hub needs.

Operator-scope fixes have been diverging across these three repos with no shared lineage. Empirical evidence and the backlog of unsynced PRs are tracked in [proj.repo-sync](../../work/projects/proj.repo-sync.md). The canonical example: `scripts/ci/wait-for-in-cluster-services.sh` is byte-identical-stale between hub and node-template, while cogni-poly already eliminated the divergence in [#127](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/cogni-poly/pull/127). bug.5001 is the same anti-pattern repeated.

This spec defines the invariants. The project owns the roadmap.

## Goal

Define the contract that:

1. Names a single hub for operator-scope content (cogni monorepo).
2. Declares operator-scope paths in a machine-readable manifest committed to every repo.
3. Specifies how drift is surfaced (mechanism is project-owned; the spec asserts the contract the mechanism must satisfy).
4. Requires the hub to ship multi-node fundamentals so downstream artifacts inherit them rather than re-implementing.

## Non-Goals

- The drift-detector workflow itself (project-owned, see [proj.repo-sync](../../work/projects/proj.repo-sync.md) slice S2).
- Backlog drain — project-owned (slice S3).
- Migrating cogni-poly's content into the monorepo (separate question; the contract works either way).
- Touching the artifact repos in this PR (separate coordination).
- Per-node review policy or CI invariants — see [spec.node-ci-cd-contract](./node-ci-cd-contract.md).

---

## Core Invariants

1. **HUB_IS_COGNI_MONOREPO**: `Cogni-DAO/cogni` is the canonical hub for all operator-scope content. Fixes land in the hub first; artifacts pull. Direct edits to operator-scope paths in `node-template` or `cogni-poly` are tolerated but the contract requires they round-trip through a hub PR within one sync cycle.

2. **MANIFEST_IS_SSOT**: `.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml` (in each repo, kept identical via the same sync mechanism) is the single declaration of which paths are operator-scope. No path is in scope unless declared. Adding a path to scope is itself a hub PR.

3. **MANIFEST_BOOTSTRAP**: The manifest is itself an operator-scope path and propagates by the same mechanism as any other in-scope file. Schema changes (i.e., changes to `.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml`'s structure) MUST land hub → artifacts in lock-step: the hub PR that changes the schema MUST also patch the validators in each artifact. At v1, the hub PR's drift-detector run reports red until the artifact PRs land, and reviewers enforce the lock-step ordering — hard-blocking via cross-repo required check is a v1.1 follow-up (same pragmatism as Backflow). Initial bootstrap of `.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml` into each repo is a one-time manual PR per repo (project slice S1) — after which the manifest sustains its own propagation.

4. **DECLARED_DIVERGENCE**: Any intentional divergence between a hub path and its artifact counterpart MUST appear in the manifest's `divergences:` block with a `reason:` field. Undeclared divergence is a contract violation surfaced by the drift detector.

5. **MULTI_NODE_OUT_OF_BOX**: The hub MUST ship multi-node fundamentals (catalog-driven Caddyfile, catalog-driven `deploy-infra.sh` per-node env vars, catalog-driven CI gating). node-template ports the relevant operator-hosted node contract without becoming an in-tree hub source directory. Single-node hardcoding in operator-scope paths is a contract violation regardless of which repo it lives in.

6. **ONE_FIX_ONE_LINEAGE**: A fix that addresses the same root cause as an existing upstream PR MUST cite the upstream PR in its description and be cherry-picked or rebased onto upstream's commit, not re-implemented. Reviewers reject parallel fixes with no shared lineage.

7. **CATALOG_BOUNDARY**: `infra/catalog/*.yaml` is the API between operator-scope and per-node scope. Operator-scope code reads from the catalog and never special-cases node names. Per-node source bits live in their source repo. A hub `nodes/<name>` gitlink is an operator pin, not source content.

8. **THREE_TIER_FORK_SYNC**: The `node-template → fork` propagation (a different axis from hub↔artifact drift above) is **three** tiers, by content kind: **Tier 1 — flight contract** (force-overwritten), **Tier 2 — foundational substrate** (merged, conflict-free → always auto-mergeable), **Tier 3 — node identity/presentation/product** (NEVER synced — `node-template` is a starter; sovereignty is the default). The **FOUNDATION (Tier 1 + Tier 2) is the ENUMERATED SSOT**, declared in `.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml`'s `foundation:` block (read at runtime from the template's own copy, `FOUNDATION_IS_ENUMERATED`). **Tier 3 is the COMPLEMENT** (`allChangedFiles − foundation`, `TIER3_IS_THE_COMPLEMENT`) — never enumerated — and is carved OUT of the Tier-2 merge by restoring the fork's own version of every non-foundation path. Operator mission: _build their mission (Tier 3, node-owned, sovereign-by-default), not their plumbing (Tier 1+2, synced)_. See § Three-Tier Fork Sync.

```

**Primary flow:** hub → artifacts (forward sync).
**Edge-case flow:** artifact → hub → artifacts (backflow, when a fix lands in cogni-poly first; must round-trip through hub).

`nodes/poly/` exists in cogni-poly but not in the hub; it is fork-owned content outside the contract. If the monorepo adopts poly as a hub-side node in the future, that becomes a hub-mirrored relationship, requiring a manifest entry.

---

## Operator-Scope Manifest (inverse form, schema 2)

**Location:** `.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml` at repo root.
**Contract:** `.cogni/sync-manifest.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12, enforced in CI via `check-jsonschema`).
**Cross-reference checks:** `scripts/validate-sync-manifest-refs.mjs` (wired into `pnpm check:docs`).

**Shape.** Everything under the hub is shared by default. The manifest enumerates only:

1. `exclude[]` — global caches/junk that nothing cares about (`.git/**`, `node_modules/**`, etc.)
2. `divergences[]` — one entry per artifact with:
   - `omit_from_artifact[]` — paths the hub has that THIS artifact intentionally lacks
   - `artifact_only[]` — paths THIS artifact has that the hub intentionally lacks

Anything not covered by `exclude` or the artifact's divergence MUST mirror 1:1. The detector treats any file outside those lists with a hash mismatch as **drift**.

This is the inverse of the v1 (schema=1) form, which enumerated `scope[]` of included paths. Inversion makes "I added a new operator-scope dir but forgot to update the manifest" an impossible class of bug.

See the live file for current content. The schema is the durable contract; if doc and live drift, the schema wins.

The manifest also carries a top-level **`foundation:`** glob block — the Tier-1+Tier-2 allowlist consumed by § Three-Tier Fork Sync below. It is a **different axis** from `divergences[]`, and the two have **opposite default polarities** by design:

- `divergences[]` models the **hub↔artifact MIRROR** relationship (cogni ↔ standalone-node): the repos are near-identical, so the default is _shared_, and the manifest enumerates the few intentional divergences. Consumed by the drift-detector (`detect-sync-drift.mjs`).
- `foundation:` models the **node-template→product-fork** relationship: a fork is a sovereign product built on a shared platform, so the default is _sovereign_, and the manifest enumerates the foundation (the platform allowlist). Consumed by the operator's fork-sync at runtime.

**Why two declarations, not one** (the axis-unification call): the drift-detector never consumed `foundation`/`node_local` — it reads only `exclude`, `artifacts`, and `divergences`. The two relationships are not the same shape (mirror vs platform-fork) and carry opposite defaults (shared-by-default vs sovereign-by-default), so collapsing them into one declaration would force the detector to subtract a "foundation view" it has no use for — coupling with no consumer benefit. We keep them as **two co-located blocks in the one manifest file** (one SSOT _location_), each scoped to its own relationship and documented as a distinct axis. A path may legitimately appear in neither, one, or both.

---

## Three-Tier Fork Sync

The hub↔artifact drift model above is the **detector** axis (surfacing). The **`node-template → spawned fork`** propagation is a separate, actively-pushing axis: on a push to `node-template`'s default branch the operator GitHub App opens sync PRs on every child fork (`dispatchCanonicalForkSync` → `fanOutForkSync`). It is **three tiers, by content kind** — and the polarity is **foundation-allowlist** (the foundation is enumerated; Tier 3 is the complement):

| Tier                                         | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Mechanism                                                                                                                 | Mergeability                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 — Flight contract**                      | `.github/workflows/{ci.yaml,pr-build.yml,pr-lint.yaml}`, `scripts/check-node-ci-workflow.mjs` (`CI_CONTRACT_PATHS`) — **enumerated in `foundation`**                                                                                              | Surgical force-overwrite (`syncCanonicalFilesToFork`)                                                                     | byte-safe, lands even when Tier 2 conflicts                                 |

### Invariants

- **`FOUNDATION_IS_ENUMERATED`**: the SSOT is the **foundation** (Tier 1 + Tier 2 — the platform substrate), **declared as data** in `node-template`'s `.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml#foundation`, read at runtime from the template at the pushed SHA (`OperatorDeployPlanePort.resolveFoundationPaths`). A node-template PR that **grows the shared substrate** adds the path to `foundation` **in the same PR**. A hardcoded floor (`nodes/operator/app/src/shared/node-app-scaffold/node-local-paths.ts`, `DEFAULT_FOUNDATION_PATHS`) is used only when the template manifest omits the block. The operator **never enumerates Tier 3**.
- **`TIER3_IS_THE_COMPLEMENT`**: a path is node-local (Tier 3) **iff it is not in the foundation allowlist** (`allChangedFiles − foundation`). This makes **sovereignty the default and the platform an opt-in allowlist** — the BaaS shape (`node declares shape; operator wires environment`; sovereignty default, platform allowlist). Inverting it (enumerate Tier 3, derive Tier 2 as "everything else") would make synced the default and sovereignty opt-out — backwards for a BaaS.
- **`TIER3_NEVER_SYNCED`**: `node-template` is a **starter**, not a parent — its identity/presentation/product must never overwrite a fork's. The Tier-2 merge tree restores each non-foundation path to the **fork's** `main` version (and deletes any non-foundation file the upstream introduced that the fork lacks) before the PR opens.
- **`TIER2_IS_ALWAYS_MERGEABLE`**: carving Tier 3 (the complement) OUT of the Tier-2 merge is precisely what removes the recurring conflict class (a node-template homepage/branding PR colliding with every fork's own homepage). With Tier 3 gone from the diff, Tier 1 + Tier 2 are conflict-free and a fork can always auto-merge them.
- **`TIERS_DECOUPLED`**: per-tier, per-fork error isolation — a Tier-1 failure never blocks Tier 2 and vice versa.

### Why this polarity (failure-mode asymmetry)

The choice of which set to enumerate is decided by what happens when you get the list wrong:

- **Miss a path in the `foundation` allowlist** → a fork misses a substrate update. Staleness, **drift-detectable, NON-destructive** — the fork keeps working; the substrate just lags until the path is added.
- **Miss a path in an enumerate-Tier-3 list** → a fork's sovereign code is silently **clobbered or conflicted** by the merge. **Destructive**, violates the core invariant (a starter overwriting a product).

So enumerate the finite, safe-to-miss thing — the **foundation**. You cannot enumerate an infinite, fork-defined product surface anyway, and a hardcoded Tier-3 floor is the operator _guessing_ the node's sovereign shape — exactly the anti-BaaS coupling this contract forbids.

### Why this shape (the #30 symptom)

Before this, Tier 2 merged the _whole repo_, so a node-template homepage PR ([node-template#30](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template/pull/30)) swept node-local presentation into every fork. The resulting fork PRs (oss/beacon) came up **DIRTY** — conflicted on the forks' own homepages — _and_ carried real cognition-substrate edits (`app/src/app/api/v1/cognition/_bundle.ts`, `packages/knowledge-base/src/seeds/base.ts`) in the same PR. You could neither merge (forces unwanted homepage) nor close (drops substrate). Splitting the enumerated foundation (Tier 2, synced) from the sovereign complement (Tier 3, node-owned) dissolves the bind: the substrate flows automatically; the homepage stays the fork's.

### Mechanism

Approach: **restore-the-fork's-version inside the merge** (not a declared-allowlist re-implementation of Tier 2). The upstream commit is materialized as the living branch `cogni-operator/node-template-upstream`; before the PR opens, `carveOutNodeLocalPaths` rewrites that branch tip so every **non-foundation** path matches the fork's `main` (override the blob; or delete it if the fork lacks it). This keeps Tier 2 a real three-way merge (preserving legitimate fork substrate edits) while guaranteeing Tier 3 (the complement) never appears in the diff. When no non-foundation path diverges, no carve commit is created and the branch points straight at the template SHA.

---

## Sync Mechanism

### v1 — Manifest + Drift-Detector Workflow (ships in this PR)

**As-built.** `.github/workflows/sync-drift-detector.yml` runs `scripts/ci/detect-sync-drift.mjs` on a daily schedule, on push:main when the manifest or detector itself changes, and on `workflow_dispatch`. The detector clones each declared `public` artifact at HEAD, walks every hub file not covered by `exclude` or the artifact's `omit_from_artifact`, sha256-diffs each, then classifies drift into:

- 🟡 **different** — same path on both, content mismatch.
- 🔴 **missing-on-artifact** — hub has it, artifact doesn't, divergence does not declare the omission.
- 🟣 **only-on-artifact** — artifact has it, hub doesn't, divergence does not declare the addition (backflow candidate).

The workflow upserts a tracking issue on the hub labeled `sync-drift` with the markdown report as the body. Issue title carries the count; body uses collapsible `<details>` per drift class. Existing open issue is updated in place (idempotent). Zero drift + no existing issue = no-op.

**Permissions.** `contents: read` + `issues: write` on the hub. No PAT, no GitHub App — the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is sufficient for v0.1 because:

- Public artifacts (`Cogni-DAO/standalone-node`) are cloned anonymously.
- Private artifacts (`Cogni-DAO/cogni-poly`) are skipped with an explicit `⏭️ skipped — visibility=private` line in the report. v0.2 plumbing for a PAT or GitHub App is a separate slice.
- The detector does NOT open PRs on artifact repos. It only surfaces drift on the hub as an issue. Auto-PR-on-artifact is v0.2.

**OSS-first survey.** Existing tools considered and rejected:

- `repo-file-sync-action`, Renovate regex managers, `copier` — all do hub → artifact file propagation but none model `omit_from_artifact` + `artifact_only` together (the two-direction divergence the contract requires).
- `josh-proxy` is the v2 mechanism (see below).

**Acceptance test.** Running the detector against current main produces a non-empty drift list, and at least one entry is `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` differing between hub and node-template (that is the bug.5001 anti-pattern made visible). PR #1355 includes a recorded run as the closeout evidence.

### v0.2 / v1.1 — what's deliberately deferred

- **Cogni-poly coverage.** Needs a PAT or GitHub App installation to clone the private repo. Separate slice.
- **Auto-PR on artifact.** Detector currently surfaces drift as a hub issue only. Auto-PR-against-artifact needs write perms on the artifact repos (App install or PAT).
- **Backflow auto-PR-on-hub.** Same constraint.
- **Branch-protection enforcement** on artifact-side `needs-hub-lineage`. v1.1.

### v2 — Josh-Proxy as Shape A Catalog Service

**Approach.** Deploy [josh-proxy](https://josh-project.github.io/josh/) as a Shape A catalog service (validated via the [cogni-poly#128](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/cogni-poly/pull/128) onboarding pattern). Define josh filters that expose operator-scope subdirectories of the cogni monorepo as virtual git repos. Artifacts (`node-template`, `cogni-poly`) become filtered views: clone, edit, push back through the proxy, and changes apply to the hub with history preserved bidirectionally.

**Why second, not first.**

- Requires the manifest from v1 (filters are derived from `scope:`).
- Requires hosting a daemon (small VM or in-cluster pod) — platform-grade infra.
- Filter authoring is a DSL; bus-factor risk.
- Self-bootstrapping fit: deploying josh via the catalog _is_ the contract test for "adding a service is easy."

**v2 entry criterion.** If v1 is sustainable and bidirectional friction is low, v2 may be deferred indefinitely. v2 ships only if the friction cost of manifest-driven PR review exceeds the infra cost of running josh.

## Drift Acceptance Rules

A divergence between hub and artifact falls into exactly one of:

| Class             | Definition                                                                             | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Intentional**   | Path is in scope, but artifact MUST differ (e.g., node-template has no `release.yml`). | Declared in manifest `divergences:` with `reason:` field. Drift detector ignores.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Pending**       | Hub has a change not yet synced to artifact.                                           | Drift detector opens auto-PR on artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A path is **never** in two classes. If it would be, the manifest is wrong and must be updated.

## Multi-Node-Readiness Load-Bearing Test

The contract's correctness is asserted by a single property: **node-template, with zero edits to operator-scope paths, must be able to host a fork that adds a second node.**

The Caddyfile and `deploy-infra.sh` / `provision-env-vm.sh` per-node env-var blocks are catalog-driven (task.5078): `scripts/ci/render-caddyfile.sh` generates the Caddyfile from `NODE_TARGETS` (upstream port from catalog `node_port`) and the deploy/provision scripts write each node's per-env host from one `host_for_node` loop, so a fork adding a second node touches no operator-scope edge path — only its catalog entry. `scripts/ci/tests/render-caddyfile.test.sh` guards the drift. The remaining single-node assumption is the runtime compose per-service blocks + `infra/k8s/overlays/<env>/<node>` generation (ci-cd.md axiom 16 out-of-scope follow-ups).

The property is asserted by the CONTRACT_TEST below.

## CONTRACT_TEST

A repeatable validation that the contract holds end-to-end. **This test becomes load-bearing only after MULTI_NODE_OUT_OF_BOX is green** ([proj.repo-sync](../../work/projects/proj.repo-sync.md) slice S4). Before that, it documents the target state, not current state.

1. Fork `Cogni-DAO/standalone-node` to a fresh GitHub account.
2. Add a second node entry to `infra/catalog/` (per `infra/catalog/_schema.json`).
3. Add `nodes/<name>/` with the minimal Shape A service skeleton (reference: [cogni-poly#128](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/cogni-poly/pull/128)).
4. Run the standard CI gates for the fork (catalog schema + workflow checks).
5. Push to the fork and observe a green build.

**Pass criterion:** zero edits to any operator-scope path (per the manifest `scope:` glob).
**Fail criterion:** any required edit outside of `nodes/<name>/` and `infra/catalog/<name>.yaml`.
