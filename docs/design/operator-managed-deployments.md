# Operator-Managed Deployments

> How does the operator app actually manage deployments? Picture version. No jargon.

## The one idea

The operator app does **not** SSH into machines or run scripts. It does two boring things:

1. **READ** the cluster's current state (which node is live where, at what version, healthy?).
2. **WRITE** intent to git (deploy this / remove that). **Argo CD** — already running — notices the git change and makes the cluster match.

That's it. Git is the steering wheel; Argo is the engine; the operator app is the dashboard + the hands on the wheel.

```
        ┌────────────────────── OPERATOR APP (.ts) ──────────────────────┐

```

## A day in the life — three flows

### 1. SEE — "where is blue running?"

```
You open  node/blue  →  page calls DeployCapability.getDeployState(env, "blue") for each env
                     →  adapter reads Argo Application + Deployment status (in-cluster)
                     →  page shows:  candidate-a  sha 1a2b3c  ✓ healthy  1/1
                                     preview      sha 1a2b3c  ✓ healthy  1/1
                                     production   —          not deployed
```

No SSH. The operator pod runs **inside** the cluster, so it just asks the k8s/Argo API.

### 2. DEPLOY — "ship blue to preview"

```
You click [deploy to preview]
   → OperatorDeployPlanePort.dispatchNodePromote({ env: "preview", node: "blue", sourceSha })
   → the EXISTING App-dispatched flight/promote path (no new pipeline) — operator-local, RBAC-gated
   → Argo reconciles → pods roll → page flips to ✓ when /version.buildSha matches
```

The operator never invents a second deploy path. "Deploy" = the same promote-by-digest flow CI uses today, just triggered from a button + typed code instead of a `workflow_dispatch` by hand.

### 3. REMOVE — "take blue off candidate-a" (your ask)

```
You click [remove from candidate-a]  (confirm + authz check)
   → drop "blue" from candidate-a's catalog node-set  (deploy ⊆ provisioned, #1607)
   → its per-env AppSet/overlay stop rendering
   → Argo PRUNES the pods.  Reversible: re-add the env to redeploy.
```

Removal is a **clean GitOps delete**, not a hack — Argo's prune does the teardown. This is the per-node "off switch" you wanted, living right on the node page next to the env list.

## The auth question — "does the test operator need VPS auth?"

**No VPS. No SSH keys.** Reads and writes use two auths the platform already has:

| Operation                                    | What it needs                                                                                 | Why not VPS/SSH                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **READ** cluster state (`getDeployState`)    | an **in-cluster k8s ServiceAccount** with read-only RBAC on Argo `Application` + `Deployment` | the operator pod runs _inside_ candidate-a's k3s — it asks the local API; no network hop, no SSH key to leak     |
| **WRITE** intent (`OperatorDeployPlanePort`) | the **existing GitHub App** (same creds as flight today)                                      | writes go to a **git** branch / catalog, not to a machine — Argo pulls the change. Git is the only write surface |

So the only _new_ grant is a **read-only k8s ServiceAccount token** mounted into the operator pod (a 1-file RBAC manifest + the adapter using the in-cluster config). That replaces the CI scripts' SSH-and-kubectl with an in-cluster, least-privilege read. The dangerous write path (SSH + `kubectl apply` in `deploy-infra.sh`) is **not** reused — writes stay in git.

> This is also why it's safe: a compromised operator read-token can _look_ but not _touch_; touching requires a reviewable git commit through the GitHub App.

## What exists vs what's next (honest)

| Piece                                              | State                                                                                                              |

| `ProbeDeployAdapter` (v0 SEE flow, public probes)  | ✅ shipped — `serving` probe per env ⇒ live/not-live + `buildSha`; no k8s SA needed (`src/adapters/server/deploy`) |
| `GET /api/v1/nodes/[id]/deploy-state`              | ✅ shipped — developer-RBAC'd (`node.flight`) per-env read                                                         |
| `<NodeDeployments>` section on `node/[id]`         | ✅ shipped — mirrors the existing `<NodeAccess>` section                                                           |
| `ArgoDeployAdapter` (reads Argo via in-cluster SA) | ⏳ enrichment follow-up — adds `sourceSha`/`digest`/true replica counts behind the same interface                  |
| Read-only k8s ServiceAccount + RBAC manifest       | ⏳ follow-up (only needed once the Argo adapter lands)                                                             |
| `OperatorDeployPlanePort` write verbs + authz      | flight ✅ · promote ✅ (RBAC-gated) · remove ⏳ Phase 1                                                            |
| `ComputeResourcePort` (Cherry→Akash, crypto-pay)   | ⏳ deferred until Akash funded                                                                                     |

**SEE flow shipped (probe-backed v0)**: the operator app now shows, in its own UI, which envs a node
is live in (`candidate-a ✓ / preview ✓ / production ✗`), reading each env's PUBLIC surface — no
in-cluster k8s ServiceAccount required. A wizard-test junk node (live nowhere) is visibly distinct
from a real one. The richer `ArgoDeployAdapter` (sourceSha/digest/replicas, in-cluster SA) swaps in
behind the same `DeployCapability` interface as an enrichment follow-up.
